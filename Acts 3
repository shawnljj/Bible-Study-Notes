From chapter 2 v43 we can see that the apostles have been performing many wonders and signs.

Split Chapter 3 into 3 parts.
v1-10
Actors: Peter, John and the Lame man.
- Lame from birth
- Begged in front of the gate called Beautiful.
- Now that he saw Peter and John, he also begged them for money.
- The man was healed INSTANTLY.
- The man JUMPED to his feet and began to walk.
- Did it in the name of Jesus, similar results to how Jesus performed His own miracles before.
- After being healed, the man followd them into the temple, walking, jumping and praising God.
- The people recognized him as the man who used to sit at the temple gate called Beautiful, begging.
- He wants people to be filled with wonder and amazement. This attention is to help them see that he has been healed in the name of Jesus.
- He didn't walk in alone, he walked in with Peter and John.
- The people have to be amazed then they will be able to accept what Peter did.

v11-16
- 4 things the people did to Jesus:
Handed him over to be killed, Disowned him before Pilate, Disowned the Holy and Righteous One, Killed the Author of life (the Creator). Killed the person who gave them life.
- Names of Jesus:
The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers
- The people knew and respected Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. and God is the God of these people.
- Peter gave the credit to Jesus.
v 16: By faith in the name of Jesus.
- Peter pointed people to Jesus.
- Especially in a temple where people gather to worship God.

v17-26
- Jesus' suffering was part of God's prophecy.
- The people should Repent and turn to God so that their sins will be wiped clean.
- Moses said "The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your fellow Israelites." (Deut 18:15)
- When the prophets speak, the people must listen. So, everyone should now respond to Jesus.
- The people can be blessed through the Holy Spirit and through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
- Jesus has died for their sins and turn them away from their wickedness.
- Through Jesus, God fulfilled his promise with Abraham of bringing blessing to the world. And this blessing is not one of money but of salvation.
- The message of blessing of salvation has come first to you the Jews, then to the ends of the world.
- The time of refreshing is the new life that they can have in the Holy Spirit.
- All people who believe in Jesus would have the Holy Spirit.
- v21: Heaven must receive him until the time comes for God to restore everything, as he promised long ago through his holy prophets.

Main point/Big idea: 
- Peter healed the lame in the name of Jesus, prophesied Savior.
- God shows in a miracle what he has done with Jesus, and the response is that everyone should turn to Jesus.
- If we were the people of that time, would we have responded how the people responded?
- In our own lives, when we sin, or choose to please our own desires, we are rejecting Jesus as well.
- Be shameful of our sins but glad of Jesus' salvation for us.
- Stopping at answered prayers is not pointing to God.
- How to use miracles to point people to God and not to self.
- Praying for your friends is a good first step but there must be continuation to the second step to  point them to God.

Matthew 5:13-16 (Salt and Light)
- What are the things that we do that can help people see God.
- Don't stop at the miracle. Continue to share about it.

Application questions:
1) Personal. Think about themselves (place yourself in their shoes)
2) Others. Helping others
3) Community. As a community what does it mean for us.
