*Date:* `07/03/2017`

**Words are powerful and can be used for good or evil.**

## Proverbs 4:1-9
	Get Wisdom at Any Cost
	1 Listen, my sons, to a father’s instruction;
	pay attention and gain understanding.
		
	2 I give you sound learning,
	so do not forsake my teaching.
	
	3 For I too was a son to my father,
	still tender, and cherished by my mother.
	
	4 Then he taught me, and he said to me,
	“Take hold of my words with all your heart;
	keep my commands, and you will live.
	
	5 Get wisdom, get understanding;
	do not forget my words or turn away from them.
	
	6 Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you;
	love her, and she will watch over you.
	
	7 The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom.
	Though it cost all you have, get understanding.
	
	8 Cherish her, and she will exalt you;
	embrace her, and she will honor you.
	
	9 She will give you a garland to grace your head
	and present you with a glorious crown.”

### 1. Listen to wise words
We need to learn from the wise words of others. In verses 4 and 5 it describes that we should wholeheartedly 
> "take hold of my words" 

and to 
> "get wisdom, get understanding". 

It is also described as hard work in verse 7:

> The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom. Though it cost all you have, get understanding.

In this passage, the focus is on children learning from their father. 
> Listen, my sons, to a father's instruction.

Parents have a responsibility to pass on as much wisdom as possible to their children.

It is not enough to listen to wise words, we also need to live them out.
> 2 I give you sound learning,
	so do not forsake my teaching.
	
> 4 Then he taught me, and he said to me,
	“Take hold of my words with all your heart;
	keep my commands, and you will live.
	
> 5b do not forget my words or turn away from them.

**Put God's words into practice and you will acquire wisdom.**

## Matthew 24:1-31
	The Destruction of the Temple and Signs of the End Times
	24:1-51pp — Mk 13:1-37; Lk 21:5-36
	1 Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings. 
	2 “Do you see all these things?” he asked. “Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.”
	3 As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. “Tell us,” they said, “when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”
	4 Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives you. 
	5 For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will deceive many. 
	6 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 
	7 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 
	8 All these are the beginning of birth pains.
	9 “Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. 
	10 At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, 
	11 and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. 
	12 Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, 
	13 but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. 
	14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.
	15 “So when you see standing in the holy place ‘the abomination that causes desolation,’ spoken of through the prophet Daniel—let the reader understand— 
	16 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. 
	17 Let no one on the housetop go down to take anything out of the house. 
	18 Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak. 
	19 How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! 
	20 Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath. 
	21 For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now—and never to be equaled again.
	22 “If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened. 
	23 At that time if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Messiah!’ or, ‘There he is!’ do not believe it. 
	24 For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. 
	25 See, I have told you ahead of time.
	26 “So if anyone tells you, ‘There he is, out in the wilderness,’ do not go out; or, ‘Here he is, in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it. 
	27 For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 
	28 Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.
	29 “Immediately after the distress of those days
	“‘the sun will be darkened,
	and the moon will not give its light;
	the stars will fall from the sky,
	and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’
	30 “Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. 
	31 And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.
	
### 2. Hold on to the words of Jesus
Although this passage is in response to the question "When will the world end? How will it end?". Jesus' purpose was not to give a specific schedule for the future, but to help his disciples not worry or be distracted by what will happen.

There are alot of uncertainty about the endtimes, however some things are clear:
- There will be lots of false claims (v.4-5, 23-26)
- There will be upheaval, persecution, division and even falling away (v6-12)
- The love of the great body of people will grow cold (v12)
- When it actually happens, it will be obvious to everyone (v27-31)

The first time, Jesus came in weakness. The next time, he will return in **power** (v27, 30-31)

**As we wait for Jesus to return, we should hold onto his word and refuse to allow our love to grow cold. Pray for people and bless them daily**

### 3. Discern prophetic words
We need to distinguish between true and false prophecy.
Jesus warns against false prophets who will appear and deceive many people (Matthew 24:11)
Jesus affirms the words of true prophets.
> v15 "spoken of through the prophet Daniel"

### 4. Speak life-changing words
The words of the gospel are powerful and life-changing.

Romans 1:16
> For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.

## Job 35:1-37:24
	1 Then Elihu said:
	2 “Do you think this is just?
	You say, ‘I am in the right, not God.’
	3 Yet you ask him, ‘What profit is it to me,
	and what do I gain by not sinning?’
	4 “I would like to reply to you
	and to your friends with you.
	5 Look up at the heavens and see;
	gaze at the clouds so high above you.
	6 If you sin, how does that affect him?
	If your sins are many, what does that do to him?
	7 If you are righteous, what do you give to him,
	or what does he receive from your hand?
	8 Your wickedness only affects humans like yourself,
	and your righteousness only other people.
	9 “People cry out under a load of oppression;
	they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful.
	10 But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker,
	who gives songs in the night,
	11 who teaches us more than he teaches the beasts of the earth
	and makes us wiser than the birds in the sky?’
	12 He does not answer when people cry out
	because of the arrogance of the wicked.
	13 Indeed, God does not listen to their empty plea;
	the Almighty pays no attention to it.
	14 How much less, then, will he listen
	when you say that you do not see him,
	that your case is before him
	and you must wait for him,
	15 and further, that his anger never punishes
	and he does not take the least notice of wickedness.
	16 So Job opens his mouth with empty talk;
	without knowledge he multiplies words.”
	1 Elihu continued:
	2 “Bear with me a little longer and I will show you
	that there is more to be said in God’s behalf.
	3 I get my knowledge from afar;
	I will ascribe justice to my Maker.
	4 Be assured that my words are not false;
	one who has perfect knowledge is with you.
	5 “God is mighty, but despises no one;
	he is mighty, and firm in his purpose.
	6 He does not keep the wicked alive
	but gives the afflicted their rights.
	7 He does not take his eyes off the righteous;
	he enthrones them with kings
	and exalts them forever.
	8 But if people are bound in chains,
	held fast by cords of affliction,
	9 he tells them what they have done—
	that they have sinned arrogantly.
	10 He makes them listen to correction
	and commands them to repent of their evil.
	11 If they obey and serve him,
	they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity
	and their years in contentment.
	12 But if they do not listen,
	they will perish by the sword
	and die without knowledge.
	13 “The godless in heart harbor resentment;
	even when he fetters them, they do not cry for help.
	14 They die in their youth,
	among male prostitutes of the shrines.
	15 But those who suffer he delivers in their suffering;
	he speaks to them in their affliction.
	16 “He is wooing you from the jaws of distress
	to a spacious place free from restriction,
	to the comfort of your table laden with choice food.
	17 But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked;
	judgment and justice have taken hold of you.
	18 Be careful that no one entices you by riches;
	do not let a large bribe turn you aside.
	19 Would your wealth or even all your mighty efforts
	sustain you so you would not be in distress?
	20 Do not long for the night,
	to drag people away from their homes.
	21 Beware of turning to evil,
	which you seem to prefer to affliction.
	22 “God is exalted in his power.
	Who is a teacher like him?
	23 Who has prescribed his ways for him,
	or said to him, ‘You have done wrong’?
	24 Remember to extol his work,
	which people have praised in song.
	25 All humanity has seen it;
	mortals gaze on it from afar.
	26 How great is God—beyond our understanding!
	The number of his years is past finding out.
	27 “He draws up the drops of water,
	which distill as rain to the streams;
	28 the clouds pour down their moisture
	and abundant showers fall on mankind.
	29 Who can understand how he spreads out the clouds,
	how he thunders from his pavilion?
	30 See how he scatters his lightning about him,
	bathing the depths of the sea.
	31 This is the way he governs the nations
	and provides food in abundance.
	32 He fills his hands with lightning
	and commands it to strike its mark.
	33 His thunder announces the coming storm;
	even the cattle make known its approach.
	1 “At this my heart pounds
	and leaps from its place.
	2 Listen! Listen to the roar of his voice,
	to the rumbling that comes from his mouth.
	3 He unleashes his lightning beneath the whole heaven
	and sends it to the ends of the earth.
	4 After that comes the sound of his roar;
	he thunders with his majestic voice.
	When his voice resounds,
	he holds nothing back.
	5 God’s voice thunders in marvelous ways;
	he does great things beyond our understanding.
	6 He says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth,’
	and to the rain shower, ‘Be a mighty downpour.’
	7 So that everyone he has made may know his work,
	he stops all people from their labor.
	8 The animals take cover;
	they remain in their dens.
	9 The tempest comes out from its chamber,
	the cold from the driving winds.
	10 The breath of God produces ice,
	and the broad waters become frozen.
	11 He loads the clouds with moisture;
	he scatters his lightning through them.
	12 At his direction they swirl around
	over the face of the whole earth
	to do whatever he commands them.
	13 He brings the clouds to punish people,
	or to water his earth and show his love.
	14 “Listen to this, Job;
	stop and consider God’s wonders.
	15 Do you know how God controls the clouds
	and makes his lightning flash?
	16 Do you know how the clouds hang poised,
	those wonders of him who has perfect knowledge?
	17 You who swelter in your clothes
	when the land lies hushed under the south wind,
	18 can you join him in spreading out the skies,
	hard as a mirror of cast bronze?
	19 “Tell us what we should say to him;
	we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness.
	20 Should he be told that I want to speak?
	Would anyone ask to be swallowed up?
	21 Now no one can look at the sun,
	bright as it is in the skies
	after the wind has swept them clean.
	22 Out of the north he comes in golden splendor;
	God comes in awesome majesty.
	23 The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power;
	in his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress.
	24 Therefore, people revere him,
	for does he not have regard for all the wise in heart?”
	
### 5. Avoid speaking empty words
Elihu's verbal attack continued with falsehood and half-truths. He said, ‘Be assured that my words are not false’ (36:4). Actually they were. He suggested that our sins do not affect God (35:6). In fact, our sins do have an effect on God as we see supremely in the cross of Christ.

He said that Job opens his mouth with empty talk; without knowledge he multiplies words (v16) which is descriptive of Elihu's own speech.

We are all capable of talking nonsense. But this does not mean we should be slient. We should realize the potential that our words have on others.

### 6. Put God's words into practice
The words of God are not empty. We should put them into practice.
