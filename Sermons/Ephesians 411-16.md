# Ephesians 4:11-16
## Scripture
> So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.  Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ. From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.

## Study
If we are spiritually mature, we can:

### 1. Discern right from wrong
* If we are still spiritual infants, we cannot discern right from wrong, good from evil.
* Denominations that teach things that go beyond the Bible may lead Christians astray.
    * Prosperity gospel
    * other teachings that omit or exceed the Bible.

### 2. Live out the truth
* Not only speak the truth but to live out the truth.
* The church should be a place we preach, safeguard and live out the truth.
* Without truth, the church is no different from a community club.
* We have to grow in knowledge.
* **Learn the truth** and live the truth.
* Speak the truth in love.
* We have to grow in **ALL** 
    * Worship
    * Evangelism
    * Learning
    * Love
* **Christ is the head of the church**

### 3. Serve with one heart
* V16: from him, the whole body joined and held together...
* Our serving is not from ourselves but we serve because we want to glorify Jesus and minister for him.
* Besides relying on Christ, we need to depend on every supporting ligament.
* Every member of the body has to come together to build the church up.
* The work of the church is not shouldered by one person. He needs the support and assistance of every person. Then the body can be joined and held together and able to grow.
* Each part of the body does its work.
* **We need each and every member of the church to unleash your talent to build the church.**

*A mature baby can be easily recognized by the parents.*

*A mature Christian can be easily recognized by the Church.*

*A mature church can be easily recognized by Christ.*

**Through our growth in knowledge, may we be easily recognizable as children of God.**
